# odin-calculator

This project was short. Two days and I had 90% finished. There are still features to add and minor bugs to fix, such as:  

- Centralizing all global state data into one object (most likely, just going full OO and turning all functions into methods);
- Fixing the switch-signs function to change the sign of the output buffer when currOp is 'equal' and to never work with 0;
- Limit the amount of characters to be printed on screen;
- Have all stylesheets migrated to style.css and create a CSS theme machine like [in this video from Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QIiWIoCmsc&list=WL&index=31&t=30s);
- Have a dropdown box for choosing different styles;
- Etc, etc...

I did learn. A lot. But not in terms of new HTML\CSS\JS features, although it was my first time actually using the CSS Grid system. What I learned was:

- Coding is hard! Figuring out how to make the calculator work without evals was definetly a challenge. Once I was (mostly) done, I realised I had built a [simplified finite state machine](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/State_machine). This just motivated to study more! There must be more general-purpose solutions I can use.
- Coding is fun! It is one the best games I ever played and I still get dumbfounded that I can do this for a living and get paid rather well, for where I live. This is really amazing.
- I am definetly not as smart I as believed, but I can survive if I work hard and do not give up â€” which is easy, since I have a lot of fun, even though frustration creeps in sometimes.  

And this is it. For the future me reading this: Sup!
